# Vulnerability Advisor Dashboard
This application is a sample dashboard for retrieving and using information from the IBM Cloud Vulnerability Advisor APIs.  

The app is built with Node.js and the [Express Framework](https://expressjs.com).


## Before you begin

You'll need a [IBM Cloud account](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads), and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. If you use [IBM Cloud Private](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/products/ibm-cloud-private/), you need access to the [IBM Cloud Private Cloud Foundry](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_2.1.0/cloud_foundry/overview.html) environment.

## Instructions

Clone the git repo:
git clone https://github.com/IBM/VulnerabilityAdvisorDashboard.git

Retrieve your oauth token from your IBM Cloud Account:
ibmcloud login

When you login and select a region, your account ID will be printed out.
<em>Targeted region us-south

                      
API endpoint:      https://cloud.ibm.com   
Region:            us-south   
User:              test@us.ibm.com   
Account:           Test's Account (<strong>random_id_guid</strong>)   
Resource group:    default   
CF API endpoint:      
Org:                  
Space:    </em>         

Set the variable icr_account in routes/index.js to this ID:
const icr_account = 'random_id_guid'

Now get the oauth-tokens associated for this account:
<em>ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens</em>


Copy the token starting with "Bearer"
<em>$ ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens
IAM token:  Bearer eyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQi</em>

In the routes/index.js file update the "auth_token" variable with the token from the previous command:
<em>const auth_token ='Bearer eyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQi'</em>

Run the app, go to the top directory with app.js and run the node command:
<em>node app.js</em>
