# Vulnerability Advisor Dashboard
This application is a sample dashboard for retrieving and using information from the IBM Cloud Vulnerability Advisor APIs.  

The app is built with Node.js and the [Express Framework](https://expressjs.com).


## Before you begin

You'll need a [IBM Cloud account](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads), and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. 

## Instructions

### Get the Code
Clone the git repo:
<br><em>git clone https://github.com/IBM/VulnerabilityAdvisorDashboard.git</em>

### Setup Authentication to IBM Cloud
Retrieve your oauth token from your IBM Cloud Account:
<br><em>ibmcloud login</em>

When you login and select a region, your account ID will be printed out.
<em>Targeted region us-south

                      
API endpoint:      https://cloud.ibm.com   
Region:            us-south   
User:              test@us.ibm.com   
Account:           Test's Account (<strong>6cb76556cb76556cb7655</strong>)   
Resource group:    default   
CF API endpoint:      
Org:                  
Space:    </em>         

Set the variable icr_account in routes/index.js to this ID:
const icr_account = '6cb76556cb76556cb7655'

Now get the oauth-tokens associated for this account:
<br><em>ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens</em>


Copy the token starting with "Bearer"
<br><em>$ ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens
IAM token:  Bearer eyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQi</em>

In the routes/index.js file update the "auth_token" variable with the token from the previous command:
<br><em>const auth_token ='Bearer eyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQieyJraWQi'</em>

### Load Containers into the Registry
This application is most useful if you have container(s) in the registry, however they can be added after the fact as well.  If you want to push containers ahead of time you can do so as follows:

Login to the container registry: 
<br><em>ibmcloud cr login</em>

Create a namespace for the container (optional):
<br><em>ibmcloud cr namespace-add vadashboard</em>

Tag and push a container to the registry:
<br><em>docker tag dockerdemo:test1  us.icr.io/vadashboard/dockerdemo:test1
docker push us.icr.io/vadashboard/dockerdemo:test1</em>

### Run the App
Run the app, go to the top directory with app.js and run the node command:
<br><em>node app.js</em>
